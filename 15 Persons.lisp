(def-eci perceive (cognitive-state)
  :comment
  "The predicate `perceive` is a relation between an agent and an entity
  or eventuality external to the mind. Something being near a person is an
  enabling condition for perceiving it. When something is perceived, there
  is a sense organ whose intact-ness enables the perception."
