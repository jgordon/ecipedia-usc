  to really exist is for it to happen or hold now."

(def-eci positive-modality (predicate)
  :comment
  "The positive modality `p` holds of eventuality `e`. (That is, `p` is a
  predicate, e.g., `real-eventuality` or `possibility`, that labels the
  modality.) The principal property of positive modalities is that Modus
  Ponens can be applied within the modality."

(def-eci possible (predicate)
  :comment
  "An eventuality `e` is possible with respect to a set of constraints `c`
  iff the constraints do not imply a negation of the eventuality.
  Possibility is a positive modality. If an eventuality is `possible`, its
  negation is not `necessary`."

(def-eci necessary (predicate)

  if the set of constraints implies it. Necessity is a positive modality
  because of the transitivity of `imply`."

(def-eci likelihood (predicate)
  :comment
  "`d` is the likelihood of `e` really existing, given constraints `c`.
  Likelihood is with respect to an implicit set of constraints that in a
  sense defines the sample space. Making the constraints an argument allows
  us to relate likelihood to possibility and to entailment."
