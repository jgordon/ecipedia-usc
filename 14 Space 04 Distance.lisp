(def-eci spatial-unit (unit-type)
  :comment
  "A spatial unit."
  :properties (:usc spatialUnit))

;; This is in this file since its definition depends on distance.
(def-eci rhombus (quadrilateral)
  :comment
  "A rhombus is a quadrilateral whose sides are all equal."
  :properties (:usc rhombus))

;; This is in this file since its definition depends on distance.
;; This could also be a two-place predicate.
(def-eci circle (curve)
  :comment
  "A circle around a center `x` is a figure in which every line segment
  from the center to a point inside the circle is constant."

(def-eci closed-curve (curve)
  :comment
  "A closed curve has no endpoints and can be covered by a large enough
  circle."

(def-eci distance (predicate)

  "The distance between points `x1` and `x2` is `d` of unit `u`. The distance
  between an entity and itself is zero. The distance between two entities is
