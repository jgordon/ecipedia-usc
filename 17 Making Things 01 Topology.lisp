;; Relations

;; Copying the arguments from ECIpedia; I'm only asserting that their
;; `inside-region` (defined for an entity subject) is basically the same
;; as our `inside`, even though we define it for abstract spatial entities.
;; I've switched `@ground` from the (seemingly) undefined `contained-region`
;; to `spatial-region`, used in the 1+-dimension meaning mentioned above.
(def-eci inside-region (containment-relation)
  :comment
  "A spatial entity can be inside a spatial entity of the same or higher
  dimension. If a spatial entity `e1` is inside spatial entity `e2`, then
  there is at least one point they share, and all of `e1`'s points are
  also inside `e2`. We do not commit to whether endpoints are inside curves,
  borders inside their regions, or surface inside their volumes."
