(def-eci framework (abstraction)
  :comment
  "A framework has a set of entities we call its domain. The entities can
  participate in the `above2` and `right-of` spatial relations. Frameworks
  are often observer-based and hence volatile. E.g., moving around a table
  changes what counts as 'above' and 'right of'."

(def-eci coordinate-system (framework)
  :comment
  "A coordinate system is a framework in which all the axes are numeric and
  the partial ordering is 'greater than'."

  is preserved when we go from one scale to the other, and for some other
  pairs the order is reversed."
